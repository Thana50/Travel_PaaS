# PaaS Vacation Reservation Platform - MVP Interest Survey

## Project Overview

This repository is part of the initial development phase for a **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for specialized travel agencies**. The platform aims to streamline and automate key workflows, particularly:

* **Rate Negotiation:** Automating outreach and tracking with suppliers.
* **Itinerary Customization:** Simplifying the creation and modification of bespoke travel packages, with an agentic flavor to enhance travel agent capabilities.

The target audience for the PaaS platform is specialized travel agencies in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.

## Purpose of this Repository

Currently, this repository primarily houses the front-end code for an **Initial Interest & Screening Survey**. This survey is a web application designed to:

* Identify specialized travel agencies in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
* Gauge their interest in a platform that addresses the pain points of manual rate negotiation and package customization.
* Collect contact information from interested parties for a follow-up detailed survey and potential MVP partnership discussions.

## Contents

* **`survey.html` (or similar name for the survey web app):** A self-contained HTML file that renders the initial screening survey. It uses Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for styling and JavaScript for basic form validation and interaction.
* **`.gitignore`:** Standard Node.js .gitignore template to exclude unnecessary files from version control, preparing for potential future development with Node.js tools.
* **`README.md`:** This file.

## Survey Web App (`survey.html`)

### Features:
* Collects agency details, region of operation, specialization, and challenges faced.
* Gauges interest in the proposed PaaS solution.
* Allows interested agencies to provide an email for follow-up.
* Includes basic client-side form validation.
* Displays a confirmation message upon (simulated) submission.

### How to Use/Run:
1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or download `survey.html`.**
2.  **Open `survey.html` directly in any modern web browser** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3.  The survey form will be displayed and can be filled out.

### Data Collection:
* **Current State:** The provided `survey.html` script *simulates* form submission and logs the collected data to the browser's developer console. **It does not currently send data to a backend server or database.**
* **For Production Use:** To collect responses from actual users, you will need to integrate a backend data collection method. Options include:
    * Using form submission services (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms).
    * Setting up a Google Apps Script to write data to a Google Sheet.
    * Developing a custom backend API endpoint.

## Future Plans (for the PaaS Platform)

The broader vision for the PaaS platform includes:

* Development of a multi-tenant, cloud-based system.
* Integration with GDS, wholesale inventory providers, and payment gateways.
* Sophisticated tools for rate negotiation management.
* An agent-assisted itinerary builder, potentially with a traveler-facing interface for collaborative customization.
* Reporting and analytics features.

This survey is a crucial first step in validating the core concepts and identifying early adopter partners for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
